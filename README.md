# # Welcome to the " AraBERT Sentiment Analysis Project on X posts "

This project focuses on using Deep learning Models ( AraBERT ) for arabic sentiment analysis , We use MARSA dataset  for training and testing AraBERT model, which can be accessed at:

" https://github.com/imamu-asa/ASA/tree/main/MARSA-Dataset". and our data ASAAI for model validation

The goal of this project is to determine the sentiment analysis of X posts, Classifing them as positive, negative or neutral based on thier Words.

One of the main challenges in this project is collecting a set of posts to validate our model effectively. Additionally, developing a robust model that can handle various arabic expressions is another challenge.

by the end of this project, we aim to build effective sentiment classification model using Deep learning.
